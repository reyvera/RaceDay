# RaceDay

Do you enjoy running marathons, but your loved ones refuse to _refuse_ to wait at the finish line for you because you take too long? This app aims to solve this issue by allowing your _fans_ to subscribe to your location tracking, and receive live updates. They can be notified at mile markers, or an estimated arrival time to the finish line (i.e. 10 minutes until you finish). Now **everyone** can cheer you on!

## Installation

1. Follow install process for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).
2. Follow install process for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).
3. Clone repository onto your local machine.
4. Install [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) app for Mac to view design.

## Usage

**NOTE:** Must run _Meteor_ server before running _React Native_ app, otherwise a silent error will occur. This is because the mobile apps are looking to connect to the Mongo database in the Meteor application's server.
